## Notes

The Eyelash Corne is a wireless Corne variant with USB-C connectors and on/off-switch on both halfs. The full featured one has a display on both halfs and a roller on the left and a joystick on the right side, but there are also striped down variants. It can connect to 5 different BT devices - these are the profiles 1 to 5 shown in the display of the left half.

If USB output is active you can connect it by cable from the left half. See the keymap where to enable USB output - the display of the left side shows the state.

You can do a live editing of the mappings in [ZMK Studio](https://zmk.studio/) in the browser when connected by USB cable or download the app from https://zmk.studio/download and use both, USB & BT.

The [Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) offers more control and is nicer to use, but it requires to have a own repo.

I added DE keycodes from https://github.com/joelspadin/zmk-locale-generator/releases and modified the keymap_drawer.config.yaml to show the keys as I want them. If you enable the Actions, the firmware and keymap diagram get automatically built on GitHub.  From the built action you can download the new firmware as a ZIP which contains three files: settings_reset-eyelash_corne_left-zmk.uf2, eyelash_corne_studio_left.uf2, nice_view-eyelash_corne_right-zmk.uf2.

To flash the new firmware switch off both halfs, connect the left half by USB and press the reset button on the bottom twice with a paperclip. A new drive named "NICENANO" will show up. Copy "eyelash_corne_studio_left.uf2" to it. Windows sometimes complains that the copy failed as the half will disconnect directly after the copy operation - do not worry just go on. Disconnect left half and connect right half and press the reset button on the bottom twice and copy "nice_view-eyelash_corne_right-zmk.uf2" to the drive "NICENANO". Now disconnect it and switch on left and right half again. I never had to flash "settings_reset-eyelash_corne_left-zmk.uf2", but if you need to, then this should be the first file on the left half.
